==========
* This project should enable the implementation of an autonomous birds food distribution system, including an identification of each individual by their RFID chips (125 kHz technology) and a parametric distribution according to individuals and time slots. All data is saved on a removable memory media, in order to process in a second time the frequenting of the feeder.

* For more information about this project, see [Newcomers 2014 - Maxime Cauchoix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyiVRtNkrHI) and see the [document in French](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HbaWMe1Ht085f7VVjddLcBeI3NcZt-81qIP3hx4l6DE/edit?usp=sharing) and [Présentation du projet OpenFeeder au FabLab Artilect](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DaUU0x_wUZSqDEomvS16wGJ-7Y2ng5Lx9hKu_dAWyXA)

* To report a *bug* in the software or to request *a simple enhancement* contact [Developer Team](mailto:arnauld.biganzoli@gmail.com,jbtechlab@gmail.com)

* If you're interested in modifying or extending the OpenFeeder software or hardware, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas whit the developers *before* starting to work on them.
That way you can coordinate with the OpenFeeder Team and others, giving your work a higher chance
of being integrated into the official release.
